""" what is  the python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming
 language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by
  Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become 
  one of the most popular programming languages in the worl
  1.Easy to Read and Write: Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and mirrors natural language, making it accessible for beginners
2.Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier and allows for rapid prototyping
3.Object-Oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming, which helps in organizing code and reusing component
4.Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a vast standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, reading and modifying files, and working with data

5.Cross-Platform: Python runs on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi






2.use of python?

Uses and Applications of Python
Python being so popular and so technologically advanced has multiple use cases and has real-life applications. Some of the most common Python applications which are very common are discussed below.

1. Web Development
Developers prefer Python for web Development, due to its easy and feature-rich framework. They can create Dynamic websites with the best user experience using Python frameworks. Some of the frameworks are -Django, for Backend development and Flask, for Frontend development. Most internet companies, today are using Python framework as their core technology, because this is not only easy to implement but is highly scalable and efficient. Web development is one of the top Applications of Python, which is widely used across the industry to create highly efficient websites.

2. Data Science
Data scientists can build powerful AI models using Python snippets. Due to its easily understandable feature, it allows developers to write complex algorithms. Data Science is used to create models and neural networks which can learn like human brains but are much faster than a single brain. It is used to extract patterns from past data and help organizations take their decisions. Also, companies use this field to make their future investments.

3. Web Scrapping and Automation
You can also automate your tasks using Python with libraries like BeautifulSoup, pandas, matplotlib, etc. for scraping and web automation. Businesses use AI bots as customer support to cater to the needs of the customers, it not only saves their money but also proved to be providing a better customer experience. Web scrapping helps the business in analyzing their data and other competitors’ data to increase their share in the market. It will help the organizations, make their data organize and scale business by finding patterns from the scrapped data.

4. CAD
You can also use Python to work on CAD (computer-aided designs) designs, to create 2D and 3D models digitally. There is dedicated CAD software available in the market, but you can also develop CAD applications using Python also. You can develop a Python-based CAD application according to your customizability and complexity, depending on your project. Using Python for CAD development allows easy deployment and integration across cross-platforms.

5. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Using libraries like Pandas, and TensorFlow, experts can work on data analysis and machine learning applications for statistical analysis, data manipulation, etc. Python is one of the most used Programming languages in this field. It is worth saying that Python is the language of AI and ML. Python has contributed a lot to this field with its huge collection of libraries and large community support. Also, the field of Artificial intelligence and Machine learning is exponentially evolving, hence the use of Python is also going to increase a lot.

6. Game Development
Python can also be used by developers to build games using Pygame to develop 2D and 3D games. Some of the popular games built using Python are Pirates of the Caribbean, Battlefield 2, etc. Python has a library named Pygame, which is used to build interesting games. Since the gaming industry is gaining a lot market in recent years the use of these kinds of development has increased a lot in recent past. Also, it is very easy to build games using this library, you can also try to build some basic games.


 3.varibale rules?

 
 variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution. A variable is essentially a name that is assigned to a value. Unlike many other programming languages, Python variables do not require explicit declaration of type. The type of the variable is inferred based on the value assigned.

Variables act as placeholders for data. They allow us to store and reuse values in our program.
Rules for Naming Variables:

To use variables effectively, we must follow Python’s naming rules:

Variable names can only contain letters, digits and underscores (_).
A variable name cannot start with a digit.
Variable names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different).
Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, else, for) as variable names.
